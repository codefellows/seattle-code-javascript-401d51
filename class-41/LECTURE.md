## Why use React Native?

- you can use this across multiple plans.
- can use "native components" that tie very well with mobile development.
  - think access to contacts, camera, location data
- uses view image and text components instead of html , which marries to mobile os better behind the scenes


### useful commands

- `npx create-expo-app <app-name> (install the recommended cli if prompted)
- `npx expo start`  or `npx expo start --tunnel`
