# LAB - Javascript and Web Frameworks

 Teach yourself a new language or framework! Work with your team and take the next 2 class/lab sessions and learn something completely new revisiting the Salmon Cookies project, implementing it in a new framework

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Getting Started

- Visit and re-familiarize yourself with the [Salmon Cookies Project](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/)
- Create a new repository for your work, with the name of the framework you have been assigned.

## Assignment

For the purposes of educating your class/teammates, your group will implement the "Salmon Cookies" application using your assigned framework, with all features from the original assignment.

Assume, for this assignment, that your employer has asked your team to do a proof of concept of a javascript framework, to assess it's viability as a replacement for their legacy system. Your task will be to complete a full analysis report and give a presentation to the class as to your findings.

### Framework Links

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

### Documentation

Complete the README.md file included in the lab folder

### Presentation

Prepare a presentation (10-15 minutes) that details the implementation requirements of your framework. Format this as a mini-lecture, with the mindset being that your task is to quickly "spin up" a small team of developers to implement a new feature in this framework.

Give us just enough information for us to "go on" so that we could reproduce your work without having to feel the pain of R&D that you went through.

Use this [REPORT TEMPLATE](./REPORT.md) as the basis of facts for your presentation as well as your assignment in Canvas.
