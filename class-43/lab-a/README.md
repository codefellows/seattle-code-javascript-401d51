# LAB - Server Side React -- Gatsby Portfolio

React is great, but it's a client-side application, which has a negative impact on SEO -- only an empty div is actually ever sent to the browser, and your React app fills in the content on the fly.

For content driven sites, such as a Blog or a news site, where its important to have search engines like Google and Bing  properly index your site, you must render full HTML on the server side and send all of that content to the browser.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Getting Started

- Create an account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

  - Header with site title and navigation
    - Home links to the home page
    - Portfolio links to the portfolio page
  - Body section with content for the page
  - Footer with contact information (email, phone, twitter link)
