# Redux - Additional Topics

## Overview

With the core concepts of Redux in place, we can turn our attention to alternate means of store management, and exploring how Redux can help us to add fidelity to our application process

## Class Outline

<!-- To be completed by instructor -->

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Alternate Redux Store Managers
  - Ducks
  - Redux Toolkit
- Other ways to manage state
  - MobX

#### Execute

- A complete React/Redux Application
- Migration of simple Redux to either Ducks or Toolkit

## Notes

### Other ways to build and manage a Redux store

Let's face it, Redux is great, but there's a lot of "boilerplate" code that you have write, and every developer or company will have their own internal pattern for putting it all together

- File and Directory Names
- Reducer and Action Styles
- How do we model our data in the reducers

There's a few projects out there that are attempting to unify the community around some simple standard ways to build stores so that as you move between projects, you'll recognize what you see

#### Redux Toolkit

The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a "Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated" framework for making stores called the **Redux Toolkit**

This toolkit specifies a few different means of building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate

Ultimately, your store code can be as simple and declarative as this:

```javascript

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    createPost(state, action) {},
    updatePost(state, action) {},
    deletePost(state, action) {}
  }
})

// Extract the action creators object and the reducer
const { actions, reducer } = postsSlice
// Extract and export each action creator by name
export const { createPost, updatePost, deletePost } = actions
// Export the reducer, either as a default or named export
export default reducer

// --------------- Sample Use -------------- //
console.log(createPost({ id: 123, title: 'Hello World' }))
// {type : "posts/createPost", payload : {id : 123, title : "Hello World"}}

// Notice how createSlice transforms your defiition?
console.log(postsSlice)
/*
{
    name: 'posts',
    actions : {
        createPost,
        updatePost,
        deletePost,
    },
    reducer
}
*/
```
