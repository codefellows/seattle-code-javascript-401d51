# Message Queues

## Overview

To this point, we've built servers based on internal event processing and network event handling in Real Time with Socket.io. In this class, we'll be exploring ways to "Queue" messages for guaranteed delivery

## Class Outline

<!-- To Be Completed By Instructor -->

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Messaging Queues
  - Ordered (FIFO)
  - Unordered
- Architecture for a Message Queue server

#### Execute

- Build an event based messaging server
- Manage a subscription/event queue

## Notes

### Implementing Message Queues

A Queue server runs independently, and is tasked with routing events and messaging between clients.

- Any connected client can "publish" a message into the server.
- Any connected client can "subscribe" to receive messages by type.

The Queue server has the ability to see which clients are connected,  to which Queues they are attached and further, to which events they are subscribed.

The Queue server is tasked with receiving any published message and then distributing it out to all connected and subscribed clients. It must further ensure that subscribed clients can "catch up" and pull down any messages that they might have missed during a period of disconnection with the server

- `message` -  a package of information, categorized by queue (bucket) and event name
- `queue` - a list of (bucket) of events
  - i.e. "Database Events", "Filesystem Events", "Network Events", etc
- `event` - What event has happened
  - i.e. "delete, add, update, connection lost, error", etc.
- `payload` - data associated with the event
  - i.e. "record id, record information, error text", etc.

Implementing a Queue involves architecting a solution to the following high level questions

1. How do we know which clients are subscribed to which buckets and which events?
1. How do we know that clients have received all of the messages to buckets/events which they've subscribed
1. How do we re-deliver messages that were never received

We will need to:

1. Manage a list of subscribers
1. Manage a list of queues
1. Manage a list of events within the queues
1. Deliver messages to each subscriber
1. Provide a mechanism for subscribers to notify the system that they got a particular message
1. Remove the message from the subscribers' message/event queue once it's been delivered
1. Allow subscribers to "catch up" on any missed messages by looping the above
