## Whiteboard Tips and "Tricks"

- one step at a time!  see the whiteboard image, follow sequence
- do psuedocode (if time, don't confuse with algorithm)  - DO NOT let it turn into actual code
- ask QUESTIONS!!!!  
- test cases!   (make no assumptions) 
    - numbers -> whole numbers?  negative values? floats?
- stick the plan - rubric, example layout (approach). ask questions
- (this is a conversation,) check-in with interviewer often follow their plan
- self care!!!!  keep your head in the game, wiggle your tows, don't lock your knees, deep breaths.  - don't freeze up, don't need to overthink.  (This is meant to be a natural process where you can share all of your thoughts)

## Great Practice Whiteboards

> Ideally you can iteratively AND recursively navigate Linked Lists and Trees

- find midpoint of a linked list (how to use a runner)
- reverse a linked list 
- remove node (or duplicates) from a linked list - [Joe's Whiteboard]()
- Binary Tree:  be able to traverse structure and do a thing! (conditionally or not?)
- Binary Search Tree:  be able to traverse structure and do a thing! (conditionally or not?)   - Big O : time O(log n) aka (cut options in half each)
- trees - be familiar with terminology
  - leaf
  - root
  - depth first traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder) what does an inorder traversal look like for a BST - sorted array (lowest to highest values)
  - breadth first traversal

  remember the warmups!
