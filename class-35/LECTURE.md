## What are Graphs?

- a data structure that holds some nodes (vertices)
- all other data structures fit into this category
- data AND connections get "interesting"


## Terminology

- direction: when edge points from one vertex to another `[a] -> [b]`
- Node / Vertex: an object or "container" that holds some data or "value"
- Edge: connection between vertices (nodes)...  how many does it have? how many can it have?
- Degree: property of a node(vertex).  how many edges it has.
- A-cyclical: does NOT loop via edges
- Cyclical: DOES loop via edges - aka can hit the same vertex more than once while traversing
- Neighbors: vertices connected by a single edge.  one edge away. no more than one, can have many neighbors
