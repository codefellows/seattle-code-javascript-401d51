## React Testing

### Behavior Driven Development

- React Testing Library
  - sits on top of jest
  - significant React specific functionality

- How will my component behave as a user interacts with the app / component?
- What do we expect to test for?  behavior?  functionality (in our reducers / pure functions)  both... it depends.  


## React and eslint

- DO NOT bring in the class config `.eslintrc.json` file.  That particular file is for the backend.  

- We will intentionally use Create React App and VSCode's built in linter functionality.  it isn't perfect, but gets about 95%.
