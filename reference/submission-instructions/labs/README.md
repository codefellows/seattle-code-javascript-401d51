# LAB Assignment

> Review this [example of a completed lab](./example)

## Work in a daily branch within a repository for each module

For example, if you're in module 1 (notes application), on day 3:

- Repository Name: `notes`
- Branch Name: `class-03`

Each Day, you will will have a new lab assignment, based on a the topic of the day. You will be creating a new branch in your module repository to contain your code for the current assignment. You should create this as a branch from your previous day's work.

## A complete lab assignment includes:

- A README.md file that describes your work, conforming to the template
- A unique branch name for each assignment (i.e. notes-class-01)
- Working feature requirements
- Tests that assert your features are working properly
  - Running through GitHub Actions
  - High Code Coverage
- Proper file, folder names, according to the assignment
- A pull request for that branch
- A UML Diagram of your application's architecture
- High Code Quality
  - Good modular structure
  - Quality comments (JSDoc)

## Grading Notes

Your grade is based on:

- Code Quality
  - Your grader will be reviewing your Pull Request and leaving notes inline
- Test Coverage
  - Your tests must assert completion and operation of the feature tasks
  - Your tests must cover a high percentage of your code
- README
  - A Well Written README, which includes all sections in the template
  - An image of your UML
