## Cloud Computing

10 years ago...  this was totally a thing:  On-site servers that required a lot of diverse maintenance

- ## How (30 min)
  - Many VMs (Virtual Machine)  can run on one physical machine

  - Hypervisor software manages and scales these as needed

  - A Blade Cluster has up to 32 Slots each with up to 4 computers (each of which is 10x more powerful than your laptop), capable running hundreds of VMs on each
