# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Overview

"The Cloud" is at the core of most internet applications, from distributed data, to servers, to games and web/data hosting services How does it work? How can we leverage it?

## Class Outline

<!-- To Be Completed By Instructor -->

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- "The Cloud"
- "Containers"
- Virtual Server "Instances"
- CDNs and scaling horizontally

#### Execute

Use "Elastic Beanstalk" to Deploy a NodeJS server to an EC2 instance at AWS

This requires 2 parts:

1. An "Environment" (container) for our application to run in
1. The application code itself to be deployed "into" the environment

## Notes

### AWS is not free!

- Before you begin your work:
  - Become familiar with the Account/Billing pages.
  - Setup a cost alert.
  - Familiarize yourself with how to turn off any services that you create, use, or start.

> **We highly recommend that you shut off all services at AWS following the completion of this module**

### Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk (EB) will automatically wire up essential AWS services to create and deploy a running application.

For Node.js applications, this is generally just going to be an EC2 server instance along with an S3 bucket that stores our files

There are 2 ways to create a new application with EB, detailed below. Either way, all of your environments and applications will be available in the AWS Developer Console (GUI) for you to manage

### Creating an application with the Elastic Beanstalk GUI

- Choose NodeJS as your platform
- Create and upload a .zip file with your application source code
  - Do not include `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`

This will create your application and environment in one step, giving you a full GUI from where you can manage the app

### Creating an application using the command line only

First, ensure that you've installed the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and the [aws eb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html) command line utilities.

1. `eb init` - Initializes your folder as an Elastic Beanstalk application
   - Choose your region (`us-west-2`)
   - Choose `[Create new Application]`
     - Note: If you already have an application, you could also choose that to connect
   - Answer the other questions as appropriate
     - Choose Node.js at the correct version
1. `eb create my-environment-name` - Create an "environment" for your app to reside in
1. `eb deploy` to deploy your new application to your new environment
   - You'll also use this whenever you make code changes

You can then use some other `eb` commands to manage your apps

- `eb open` to open your app in the browser
- `eb list` to get a list of apps
- `eb ssh` to ssh (login) to one of your apps
- `eb health` to get a health check on  your environments

### Auto-Deploy

You can also use GitHub Actions to auto-deploy your source code to your EB Environment whenever you check in your code.

> Browse the GitHub Marketplace for actions you can import into your repo. There are many
