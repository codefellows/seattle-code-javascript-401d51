### Stack 

Stack: Data Structure with First in Last out behavior  (FILO) can also think (LIFO)

#### Use Cases:  

- when order matters and we want the last thing added to the heap
- the call stack.  think recursion
- reverse things - first thing in will be the last thing out

### Queue 

Queue:  Data Structure with FIRST in FIRST out behavior (FIFO)

### Use Cases:

- when order matters...
- we must make sure that the first concern is handled first
