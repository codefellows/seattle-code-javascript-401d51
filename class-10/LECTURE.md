## Review

Linked List:  linear collection of nodes

> simple bare bones linked list.  property:  head.

Steve: Data Structure - collection of nodes


## Stack 

Stack: Data Structure with First in Last out behavior  (FILO) can also think (LIFO)

### Use Cases:  

- when order matters and we want the last thing added to the heap
- the call stack.  think recursion
- reverse things - first thing in will be the last thing out

## Queue 

Queue:  Data Structure with FIRST in FIRST out behavior (FIFO)

## Use Cases:

- when order matters...
- we must make sure that the first concern is handled first
